# simple_springboot_chat_app
My personal springboot webapp exercise following instructor Shonna Smith.

Uses localhost:8080 by default. 

Users can join by name they prefer, and there is also a separate guest chat. When someone is typing, it can be seen real-time, albeit anonymously.

No permanent user profile feature implemented.
